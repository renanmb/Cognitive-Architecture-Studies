Write a detailed summary of the following:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. In particular, the Court cited Smith v. Allwright, United States v. Darby, and Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins. The Court also considered cases involving fundamental factual changes that had undermined the basic premise of the prior precedent, such as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn and Crawford v. Washington. Finally, the Court considered cases that involved both significant doctrinal developments and changed facts or understandings that had together undermined a basic premise of the prior decision, such as Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees and Obergefell v. Hodges.  The Supreme Court considered a number of historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v Wade. Specifically, the Court looked at cases involving sex-based classifications, jury selection, and capital punishment. The Court also considered legislative developments at the state and federal levels with regards to women's rights. In addition, the Court took into account the fact that Roe v Wade had been embedded as part of our national culture for over 50 years.  The Supreme Court considered the historical precedents of abortion when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Court found that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition. The Court also found that the underlying theory on which Casey rested- that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for liberty- has long been controversial. The Court's decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights- those rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights deemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the question is whether the right is deeply rooted in our history and tradition and whether it is essential to this Nation's scheme of ordered liberty. The Court found that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in our history and tradition and is not essential to this Nation's scheme of ordered liberty.  The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Court noted that a long line of precedents, founded in the Fourteenth Amendments concept of personal liberty, protected individual decisionmaking related to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education. The Court also recognized that the Constitution must protect a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The Court struck a balance, turning on the stage of the pregnancy at which the abortion would occur. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the State could not interfere at all with the decision to terminate a pregnancy. At any time after that point, the State could regulate to protect the pregnant womans health, such as by insisting that abortion providers and facilities meet safety requirements. And after the fetuss viabilitythe point when the fetus has the capability of meaningful life outside the mothers wombthe State could ban abortions, except when necessary to preserve the womans life or health.  The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court noted that procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right because such a right has no basis in the Constitution's text or in our Nation's history. Second, the Court noted that under our precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard for such challenges. That is, a state may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Third, the Court noted that a law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a strong presumption of validity. Fourth, the Court noted that legitimate interests justifying a state's regulation of abortion include respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development, the protection of maternal health and safety, the elimination of particularly gruesome or barbaric medical procedures, the preservation of the integrity of the medical profession, the mitigation of fetal pain, and the prevention of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or disability.  The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court considered the precedent set by Brown v. Board of Education, which overruled the previous precedent of Plessy v. Ferguson. The Court also considered the precedent set by West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, which overruled the previous precedent of Minersville School District v. Gobitis. Finally, the Court considered the precedent set by Roe itself, which overruled the previous precedent of Doe v. Bolton.  The Supreme Court considered a number of historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v Wade. Firstly, the Court considered the precedent set by the Roe decision itself. The Roe decision had grounded the right to choose abortion in the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of liberty. The Casey decision reaffirmed this right, reasoning that it was central to a woman's ability to chart her life's course. Secondly, the Court considered precedents relating to the right to contraception. In a number of cases, the Court had recognized the right of individuals to make decisions about contraception. The Court reasoned that these cases showed that the Constitution places limits on a State's right to interfere with a person's most basic decisions about family and parenthood. Thirdly, the Court considered precedents relating to the State's interest in protecting potential life. The Court acknowledged that the State has an interest in protecting potential life, but reasoned that this interest is not conclusive. The State cannot force a woman to bear a child against her will. Fourthly, the Court considered the precedent set by Roe itself, which had struck a balance between the interests of the State and the rights of the individual. The Casey decision reaffirmed this balance, holding that the State can only bar abortion after viability.  The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court considered the fact that Roe had enflamed debate and deepened division. Second, the Court considered Casey, which held that the permissibility of abortion should be resolved by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting. Third, the Court considered the fact that only six countries besides the United States permit[ted] nontherapeutic or elective abortion-on-demand after the twentieth week of gestation. Fourth, the Court considered the findings of the Mississippi legislature that most abortions after 15 weeks employ dilation and evacuation procedures which involve the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child. Fifth, the Court considered the conclusion of the Mississippi legislature that the intentional commitment of such acts for nontherapeutic or elective reasons is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession.  The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. Firstly, the Court considered the precedent set by the Roe decision itself. Secondly, the Court considered the precedent set by the Casey decision, which reaffirmed the right to abortion established in Roe. Finally, the Court considered the precedent set by other decisions recognizing constitutional rights, such as the right to free speech or the right to marry.  The Supreme Court considered a number of historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court noted that abortion was illegal at common law at least after quickening. Second, the Court noted that the 19th century saw a trend toward criminalization of pre-quickening abortions. Third, the Court noted that by 1868, a supermajority of States had enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy. Fourth, the Court noted that by the late 1950s, at least 46 States had prohibited abortion except if necessary to save the life of the mother. Finally, the Court noted that when Roe was decided in 1973, similar statutes were still in effect in 30 States.  The nature of the error made in Roe v. Wade was that the Supreme Court created a right to privacy that did not exist in the Constitution. The quality of the reasoning was poor, as the Court did not base its decision on any specific language in the Constitution. The workability of the rules imposed by Roe v. Wade has been poor, as they have led to a great deal of confusion and conflict. The disruptive effect of Roe v. Wade on other areas of the law has been significant, as it has called into question the constitutional basis for many other Supreme Court decisions. Finally, the absence of concrete reliance on Roe v. Wade makes it easier to overturn, as there is no one who would be directly harmed by its overturning.  The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v Wade. The most important precedent was the Court's decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, which held that racial segregation in public facilities was constitutional. The Court later overruled Plessy in Brown v. Board of Education, holding that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. The Court also considered other cases in which it had overruled prior decisions, such as Mapp v. Ohio (exclusionary rule), Smith v. Allwright (voting rights), and Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins (federalism). The Court also considered the dissent in Roe by Justice White,

The Court also considered the dissent in Roe by Justice White, who argued that the majority opinion was based on a "mythical right to privacy."
