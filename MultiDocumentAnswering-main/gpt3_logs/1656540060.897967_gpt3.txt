QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: this case, 26 States expressly ask us to overrule Roe and Casey and to return the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives. This Courts inability to end debate on the issue should not have been surprising. This Court cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settlement and telling the people to move on. Whatever influence the Court may have on public attitudes must stem from the Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 69 Opinion of the Court strength of our opinions, not an attempt to exercise raw judicial power. Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (White, J., dissenting). We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to todays decision overruling Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision. We can only do our job, which is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. We therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe and Casey must be overruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives. V A 1 The dissent argues that we have abandon[ed] stare decisis, post, at 30, but we have done no such thing, and it is the dissents understanding of stare decisis that breaks with tradition. The dissents foundational contention is that the Court should never (or perhaps almost never) overrule an egregiously wrong constitutional precedent unless the Court can poin[t] to major legal or factual changes undermining [the] decisions original basis. Post, at 37. To support this contention, the dissent claims that Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, and other landmark cases overruling prior precedents responded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society. Post, at 43. The unmistakable implication of this argument is that only the passage of time and new developments justified those decisions. Recognition that the cases they overruled were egregiously wrong on the day they were handed down was not enough. The Court has never adopted this strange new version of  70 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court stare decisisand with good reason. Does the dissent really maintain that overruling Plessy was not justified until the country had experienced more than a half-century of statesanctioned segregation and generations of Black school children had suffered all its effects? Post, at 4445. Here is another example. On the dissents view, it must have been wrong for West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, to overrule Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis, 310 U. S. 586, a bare three years after it was handed down. In both cases, children who were Jehovahs Witnesses refused on religious grounds to salute the flag or recite the pledge of allegiance. The Barnette Court did not claim that its reexamination of the issue was prompted by any intervening legal or factual developments, so if the Court had followed the dissents new version of stare decisis, it would have been compelled to adhere to Gobitis and countenance continued First Amendment violations for some unspecified period. Precedents should be respected, but sometimes the Court errs, and occasionally the Court issues an important decision that is egregiously wrong. When that happens, stare decisis is not a straitjacket. And indeed, the dissent eventually admits that a decision could be overruled just because it is terribly wrong, though the dissent does not explain when that would be so. Post, at 45. 2 Even if the dissent were correct in arguing that an egregiously wrong decision should (almost) never be overruled unless its mistake is later highlighted by major legal or factual changes, reexamination of Roe and Casey would be amply justified. We have already mentioned


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court considered the precedent set by Brown v. Board of Education, which overruled the previous precedent of Plessy v. Ferguson. The Court also considered the precedent set by West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, which overruled the previous precedent of Minersville School District v. Gobitis. Finally, the Court considered the precedent set by Roe itself, which overruled the previous precedent of Doe v. Bolton.
