The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations, upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.

I The law at issue in this case, Mississippis Gestational Age Act, see Miss. Code Ann. 4141191 (2018), contains this central provision: Except in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform . . . or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks. 4(b).14 To support this Act, the legislature made a series of factual findings.

DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court considered the fact that Roe had enflamed debate and deepened division. Second, the Court considered Casey, which held that the permissibility of abortion should be resolved by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting. Third, the Court considered the fact that only six countries besides the United States permit[ted] nontherapeutic or elective abortion-on-demand after the twentieth week of gestation. Fourth, the Court considered the findings of the Mississippi legislature that most abortions after 15 weeks employ dilation and evacuation procedures which involve the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child. Fifth, the Court considered the conclusion of the Mississippi legislature that the intentional commitment of such acts for nontherapeutic or elective reasons is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession.
