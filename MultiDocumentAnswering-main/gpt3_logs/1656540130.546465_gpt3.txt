QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: similar regard for a States interest in protecting prenatal life. The dissent repeatedly praises the balance, post, at 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, that the viability line strikes between a womans liberty interest and the States interest in prenatal life. But for reasons we discuss later, see infra, at 5054, 5556, and given in the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, post, at 25 (opinion concurring in judgment), the viability line makes no sense. It was not adequately justified in Roe, and the dissent does not even try to defend it today. Nor does it identify any other point in a pregnancy after which a State is permitted to prohibit the destruction of a fetus. Our opinion is not based on any view about if and when prenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after birth. The dissent, by contrast, would impose on the people a particular theory about when the rights of personhood begin. According to the dissent, the Constitution requires the States to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basic human rightto liveat least until an arbitrary point in a pregnancy has passed. Nothing in the Constitution or in Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 39 Opinion of the Court our Nations legal traditions authorizes the Court to adopt that theory of life. Post, at 8. III We next consider whether the doctrine of stare decisis counsels continued acceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role in our case law, and we have explained that it serves many valuable ends. It protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 856 (joint opinion); see also Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991). It reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation. Kimble, 576 U. S., at 455. It fosters evenhanded decisionmaking by requiring that like cases be decided in a like manner. Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. It contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process. Ibid. And it restrains judicial hubris and reminds us to respect the judgment of those who have grappled with important questions in the past. Precedent is a way of accumulating and passing down the learning of past generations, a font of established wisdom richer than what can be found in any single judge or panel of judges. N. Gorsuch, A Republic, If You Can Keep It 217 (2019). We have long recognized, however, that stare decisis is not an inexorable command, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted), and it is at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution, Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997). It has been said that it is sometimes more important that an issue be settled than that it be settled right. Kimble, 576 U. S., at 455 (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). But when it comes to the interpretation of the Constitution the great charter of our liberties, which was meant to en-   40 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court dure through a long lapse of ages, Martin v. Hunters Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326 (1816) (opinion for the Court by Story, J.)we place a high value on having the matter settled right. In addition, when one of our constitutional decisions goes astray, the country is usually stuck with the bad decision unless we correct our own mistake. An erroneous constitutional decision can be fixed by amending the Constitution, but our Constitution is notoriously hard to amend. See Art. V; Kimble, 576 U. S., at 456. Therefore, in appropriate circumstances we must be willing to reconsider and, if necessary, overrule constitutional decisions. Some of our most important constitutional decisions have overruled prior precedents. We mention three. In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court repudiated the separate but equal doctrine, which had allowed


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. One precedent was the Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine that had previously allowed racial segregation in public schools. Another precedent was the Court's decision in Loving v. Virginia, which overturned a state law banning interracial marriage. Finally, the Court considered its own previous decision in Roe v. Wade, which it overturned in this case.
