QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: obtain an abortion. For millions of women, Roe and Casey have been critical in giving them control of their bodies and their lives. Closing our eyes to the suffering todays decision will impose will not make that suffering disappear. The majority cannot escape its obligation to count[] the cost[s] of its decision by invoking the conflicting arguments of contending sides. Casey, 505 U. S., at 855; ante, at 65. Stare decisis requires that the Court calculate the costs of a decisions repudiation on those who have relied on the decision,  28The majoritys sole citation for its concreteness requirement is Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991). But Payne merely discounted reliance interests in cases involving procedural and evidentiary rules. Id., at 828. Unlike the individual right at stake here, those rules do not alter primary conduct. Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 252 (1998). Accordingly, they generally do not implicate the reliance interests of private parties at all. Alleyne v. United States, 570 U. S. 99, 119 (2013) (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring).  54 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting not on those who have disavowed it. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 855. More broadly, the majoritys approach to reliance cannot be reconciled with our Nations understanding of constitutional rights. The majoritys insistence on a concrete, economic showing would preclude a finding of reliance on a wide variety of decisions recognizing constitutional rights such as the right to express opinions, or choose whom to marry, or decide how to educate children. The Court, on the majoritys logic, could transfer those choices to the State without having to consider a persons settled understanding that the law makes them hers. That must be wrong. All those rights, like the right to obtain an abortion, profoundly affect and, indeed, anchor individual lives. To recognize that people have relied on these rights is not to dabble in abstractions, but to acknowledge some of the most concrete and familiar aspects of human life and liberty. Ante, at 64. All those rights, like the one here, also have a societal dimension, because of the role constitutional liberties play in our structure of government. See, e.g., Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 443 (recognizing that Miranda warnings have become part of our national culture in declining to overrule Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966)). Rescinding an individual right in its entirety and conferring it on the State, an action the Court takes today for the first time in history, affects all who have relied on our constitutional system of government and its structure of individual liberties protected from state oversight. Roe and Casey have of course aroused controversy and provoked disagreement. But the right those decisions conferred and reaffirmed is part of societys understanding of constitutional law and of how the Court has defined the liberty and equality that women are entitled to claim. After today, young women will come of age with fewer  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 55 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting rights than their mothers and grandmothers had. The majority accomplishes that result without so much as considering how women have relied on the right to choose or what it means to take that right away. The majoritys refusal even to consider the life-altering consequences of reversing Roe and Casey is a stunning indictment of its decision. D One last consideration counsels against the majoritys ruling: the very controversy surrounding Roe and Casey. The majority accuses Casey of acting outside the bounds of the law to quell the conflict over abortionof imposing an unprincipled settlement of the issue in an effort to end national division. Ante, at 67. But that is not what Casey did. As shown above, Casey applied traditional principles of stare decisiswhich the majority today ignoresin reaffirming


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. Firstly, the Court considered the precedent set by the Roe decision itself. Secondly, the Court considered the precedent set by the Casey decision, which reaffirmed the right to abortion established in Roe. Finally, the Court considered the precedent set by other decisions recognizing constitutional rights, such as the right to free speech or the right to marry.
