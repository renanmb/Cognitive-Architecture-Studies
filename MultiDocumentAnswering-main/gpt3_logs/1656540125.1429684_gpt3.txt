QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: and where a person put skewers into the woman for the same purpose, by which in both cases the women were killed, these acts were clearly held to be murder (footnotes omitted)); 1 E. East, Pleas of the Crown 230 (1803) (similar).  20 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court points in pregnancy, none endorsed the practice. Moreover, we are aware of no common-law case or authority, and the parties have not pointed to any, that remotely suggests a positive right to procure an abortion at any stage of pregnancy. b In this country, the historical record is similar. The most important early American edition of Blackstones Commentaries, District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 594 (2008), reported Blackstones statement that abortion of a quick child was at least a heinous misdemeanor, 2 St. George Tucker, Blackstones Commentaries 129130 (1803), and that edition also included Blackstones discussion of the proto-felony-murder rule, 5 id., at 200201. Manuals for justices of the peace printed in the Colonies in the 18th century typically restated the common-law rule on abortion, and some manuals repeated Hales and Blackstones statements that anyone who prescribed medication unlawfully to destroy the child would be guilty of murder if the woman died. See, e.g., J. Parker, Conductor Generalis 220 (1788); 2 R. Burn, Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer 221222 (7th ed. 1762) (English manual stating the same).30  30For manuals restating one or both rules, see J. Davis, Criminal Law 96, 102103, 339 (1838); Conductor Generalis 194195 (1801) (printed in Philadelphia); Conductor Generalis 194195 (1794) (printed in Albany); Conductor Generalis 220 (1788) (printed in New York); Conductor Generalis 198 (1749) (printed in New York); G. Webb, Office and Authority of a Justice of Peace 232 (1736) (printed in Williamsburg); Conductor Generalis 161 (1722) (printed in Philadelphia); see also J. Conley, Doing It by the Book: Justice of the Peace Manuals and English Law in Eighteenth Century America, 6 J. Legal Hist. 257, 265, 267 (1985) (noting that these manuals were the justices primary source of legal reference and of practical value for a wider audience than the justices). For cases stating the proto-felony-murder rule, see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Parker, 50 Mass. 263, 265 (1845); People v. Sessions, 58 Mich. Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 21 Opinion of the Court The few cases available from the early colonial period corroborate that abortion was a crime. See generally Dellapenna 215228 (collecting cases). In Maryland in 1652, for example, an indictment charged that a man Murtherously endeavoured to destroy or Murther the Child by him begotten in the Womb. Proprietary v. Mitchell, 10 Md. Archives 80, 183 (1652) (W. Browne ed. 1891). And by the 19th century, courts frequently explained that the common law made abortion of a quick child a crime. See, e.g., Smith v. Gaffard, 31 Ala. 45, 51 (1857); Smith v. State, 33 Me. 48, 55 (1851); State v. Cooper, 22 N. J. L. 52, 5255 (1849); Commonwealth v. Parker, 50 Mass. 263, 264268 (1845). c The original ground for drawing a distinction between pre- and post-quickening abortions is not entirely clear, but some have attributed the rule to the difficulty of proving that a pre-quickening fetus was alive. At that time, there were no scientific methods for detecting pregnancy in its early stages,31 and thus, as one court put it in 1872: [U]ntil the period of quickening there is no evidence of life; and whatever may be said of the feotus, the law has fixed upon this period of gestation as the time when the child is endowed with life because foetal movements are the first clearly marked and well defined evidences of life. Evans v. People, 49 N. Y. 86, 90 (emphasis added); Cooper, 22 N. J. L., at 56 (In contemplation of law life commences at the moment of quickening, at that moment when the embryo gives the first physical proof of life, no matter
