QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: rooted in the Nations history and tradition and whether it is an essential component of ordered liberty. The Court finds that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nations history and tradition. The underlying theory on which Casey restedthat the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for libertyhas long been controversial. The Courts decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rightsthose rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights deemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the question is whether the right is deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition and whether it is essential to this Nations scheme of ordered liberty. Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted). The term liberty alone provides little guidance. Thus, historical inquiries are essential whenever the Court is asked to recognize a new component of the liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by liberty, the Court must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what the Fourteenth Amendment protects with the Courts own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. For this reason,      Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 3 Syllabus the Court has been reluctant to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125. Guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of the Nations concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the Fourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abortion. Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy. This consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey declined to reconsider Roes faulty historical analysis. Respondents argument that this history does not matter flies in the face of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Solicitor General repeats Roes claim that it is doubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus, 410 U. S., at 136, but the great common-law authoritiesBracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstoneall wrote that a postquickening abortion was a crime. Moreover, many authorities asserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was unlawful and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt. The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an abortion right because of the common laws failure to criminalize abortion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not universal, see Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633; State v. Slagle, 83 N. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered the historical precedents of abortion when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Court found that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition. The Court also found that the underlying theory on which Casey rested- that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for liberty- has long been controversial. The Court's decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights- those rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights deemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the question is whether the right is deeply rooted in our history and tradition and whether it is essential to this Nation's scheme of ordered liberty. The Court found that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in our history and tradition and is not essential to this Nation's scheme of ordered liberty.
