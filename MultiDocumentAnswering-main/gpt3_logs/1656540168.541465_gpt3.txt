The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court has a long history of protecting the right to bodily integrity.

Second, the Court has a long history of protecting private choices about family matters, child rearing, and intimate relationships.  The Supreme Court considered the historical precedent of Roe v. Wade when deciding to overturn it. Roe v. Wade was a decision that was made by the Supreme Court in 1973 that legalized abortion nationwide. The decision was based on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects a woman's right to privacy. However, the Supreme Court has since overruled Roe v. Wade, and has instead ruled that each state has the right to regulate abortion as it sees fit.  The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. One of those precedents was the case of Loving v. Virginia, in which the Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to marry regardless of race. The Court also considered the case of Washington v. Glucksberg, in which the Court rejected the idea that the Fourteenth Amendment should be interpreted narrowly to only protect rights that were specifically mentioned in the Constitution. Instead, the Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment should be interpreted more broadly to protect rights that are fundamental to liberty and equality.  The Supreme Court considered historical precedents involving the right to marry a person of a different race, the right to marry while in prison, the right to obtain contraceptives, the right to reside with relatives, the right to make decisions about the education of ones children, the right not to be sterilized without consent, and the right in certain circumstances not to undergo involuntary surgery, forced administration of drugs, or other substantially similar procedures.  According to the passage, the Supreme Court considered historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. Specifically, the Court looked at Blackstone's Commentaries and other manuals from the colonial period that stated that abortion was a crime. The Court also looked at cases from the early colonial period that corroborated that abortion was a crime.  The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. One precedent was the Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine that had previously allowed racial segregation in public schools. Another precedent was the Court's decision in Loving v. Virginia, which overturned a state law banning interracial marriage. Finally, the Court considered its own previous decision in Roe v. Wade, which it overturned in this case.  The Supreme Court considered three historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade: (1) the doctrine that undermined or made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change that had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance because the earlier decision was less than a decade old. None of these factors applied in the case of Roe v. Wade, as there was no significant legal or factual change that supported overturning the decision. The Court also considered the principle of stare decisis, which holds that precedent should be followed unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. In this case, the Court found that there was no compelling reason to overturn Roe v. Wade, as it was still a workable decision with no changes in law or fact that had eroded its validity.
