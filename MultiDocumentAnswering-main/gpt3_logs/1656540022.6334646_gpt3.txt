QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 659662 (1944) (recognizing all-white primaries are unconstitutional after reconsidering in light of the unitary character of the electoral process recognized in United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299 (1941), and overruling Grovey v. Townsend, 295 U. S. 45 (1935)); United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 115117 (1941) (recognizing Congresss Commerce Clause power to regulate employment conditions and explaining as inescapable the conclusion . . . that Hammer v. Dagenhart, [247 U. S. 251 (1918)], and its contrary rule had long since been overtaken by precedent construing the Commerce Clause power more broadly); Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 7880 (1938) (applying state substantive law in diversity actions in federal courts and overruling Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1 (1842), because an intervening decision had made clear the fallacy underlying the rule). Additional cases the majority cites involved fundamental factual changes that had undermined the basic premise of the prior precedent. See Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn, 558 U. S. 310, 364 (2010) (expanding First Amendment protections for campaign-related speech and citing technological changes that undermined the distinctions of the earlier regime and made workarounds easy, and overruling Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652 (1990), and partially overruling McConnell v. Federal Election Commn, 540 U. S. 93 (2003)); Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 6265 (2004) (expounding on the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses and rejecting the prior framework, based on its practical failing to keep  31We have since come to understand Gideon as part of a larger doctrinal shiftalready underway at the time of Gideonwhere the Court began to hold that the Due Process Clause fully incorporates particular rights contained in the first eight Amendments.

S. 25 (1949), after considering and rejecting the current validity of the factual grounds upon which Wolf was based). Some cited overrulings involved both significant doctrinal developments and changed facts or understandings that had together undermined a basic premise of the prior decision. See Janus v.

DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. In particular, the Court cited Smith v. Allwright, United States v. Darby, and Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins. The Court also considered cases involving fundamental factual changes that had undermined the basic premise of the prior precedent, such as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn and Crawford v. Washington. Finally, the Court considered cases that involved both significant doctrinal developments and changed facts or understandings that had together undermined a basic premise of the prior decision, such as Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees and Obergefell v. Hodges.
