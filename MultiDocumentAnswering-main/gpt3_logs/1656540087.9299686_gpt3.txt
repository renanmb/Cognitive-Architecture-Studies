S. ____ (2022) 35 Opinion of the Court Both sides make important policy arguments, but supporters of Roe and Casey must show that this Court has the authority to weigh those arguments and decide how abortion may be regulated in the States. They have failed to make that showing, and we thus return the power to weigh those arguments to the people and their elected representatives. D 1 The dissent is very candid that it cannot show that a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let alone a deeply rooted one, in this Nations history and tradition. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; see post, at 1214 (joint opinion of BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ.). The dissent does not identify any pre-Roe authority that supports such a rightno state constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state judicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise. Compare post, at 1214, n. 2, with supra, at 1516, and n. 23. Nor does the dissent dispute the fact that abortion was illegal at common law at least after quickening; that the 19th century saw a trend toward criminalization of pre-quickening abortions; that by 1868, a supermajority of States (at least 26 of 37) had enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy; that by the late 1950s at least 46 States prohibited abortion however and whenever performed except if necessary to save the life of the mother, Roe, 410 U. S., at 139; and that when Roe was decided in 1973 similar statutes were still in effect in 30 States.

T. 1964, No. 496, p. 27.  36 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court devastating to its position. We have held that the established method of substantive-due-process analysis requires that an unenumerated right be deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition before it can be recognized as a component of the liberty protected in the Due Process Clause. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; cf. Timbs, 586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But despite the dissents professed fidelity to stare decisis, it fails to seriously engage with that important precedentwhich it cannot possibly satisfy. The dissent attempts to obscure this failure by misrepresenting our application of Glucksberg. The dissent suggests that we have focused only on the legal status of abortion in the 19th century, post, at 26, but our review of this Nations tradition extends well past that period. As explained, for more than a century after 1868including

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered a number of historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court noted that abortion was illegal at common law at least after quickening. Second, the Court noted that the 19th century saw a trend toward criminalization of pre-quickening abortions. Third, the Court noted that by 1868, a supermajority of States had enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy. Fourth, the Court noted that by the late 1950s, at least 46 States had prohibited abortion except if necessary to save the life of the mother. Finally, the Court noted that when Roe was decided in 1973, similar statutes were still in effect in 30 States.
